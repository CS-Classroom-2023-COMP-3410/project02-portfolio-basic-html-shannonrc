                <td>Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery is absolutely movie of the year. 
                    It avoids the modern trend of over explaining stories for distracted viewers and instead embraces visual storytelling, complexity, and trust in the audience. 
                    The pacing is flawless, the cinematography is stunning, and the religious themes are explored with a depth rarely seen in Hollywood.
                    The characters feel more layered than any previous Knives Out film, and the unpredictability keeps every moment engaging. Josh O’Connor completely steals the show, and Rian Johnson once again proves why strong storytelling still matters. You ate.</td>

                <td>The Iron Giant is a movie I loved as a kid and somehow appreciate even more now. The idea that you’re made of metal, but you have feelings and you think about things which means you have a soul, and souls don’t die is such a beautiful and powerful concept. 
                    Watching the Giant fly into the sky to protect people who never fully accepted him still stays with me.
                    The animation is gorgeous, the storytelling is deeply human, and while I’m definitely biased because I grew up with this film, its meaning and heart truly hold up. TO THIS DAY.</td>

                <td>Avengers Age of Ultron is frustrating because it should have been incredible. Ultron was a perfect villain on paper, intelligent, philosophical, and terrifying but Marvel never let him fully become that. 
                    His potential was undercut by constant jokes and rushed pacing, turning what could have been one of Marvel’s most complex villains into a missed opportunity.
                    The movie is still one of my favorite Avenger films, but Ultron deserved better. Also RIP Pietro you deserved better too.</td>

                <td>I am about to get REAL here. About You feels like a memory you can’t place but somehow recognize immediately. It’s soft, haunting, and overwhelming in the most subtle way. 
                    The song moves slowly, letting every sound linger, like it’s afraid to rush past the feeling it’s holding onto. UGH.
                    There’s something timeless about it like longing stretched across FOR YEARS, distance, and versions of yourself that no longer exist. 
                    The vocals feel distant and intimate at the same time, as if the song is echoing from somewhere far away but still meant just for you. like WOW
                    This isn’t just a song you listen to it’s a FEELING that you return to. Every time it plays, it hits the same, but somehow deeper. Easily my favorite song of all time. hands down. </td>

                <td>Apollo Eighteen -Khamari</td>
                <td>Apollo Eighteen is one of those songs where you sit there like how did someone write this. You feel every word in best or worst way. The lyrics are insanely beautiful, quiet, and intentional.
                    It’s emotional without being dramatic, poetic without being annoyinggg, and so honest in a way that you didn't know you could experience. This is my headphones on FULL BLAST, stare at the ceiling type of song. Easy 10/10. No debate. Khamari ate.</td>

                <td>This album is literally a vibe machine in my opinion. Every song feels like driving at night with the windows down through the neon lights. It’s dreamy, ethereal, whimsical, and somehow nostalgic for a time you didn’t even live through. 
                    This album makes normal moments feel somewhat cinematic. Its so fun, floaty, and kind of retro in a way.</td>

                <td>
                  Detroit: Become Human is SUCH a cool idea. The whole AI, robots, humanity, and moral choice thing is genuinely fascinating and philosophical, and when the game leans into that, it’s really good. 
                  It feels like an interactive ethics class in the best way.
                  But the execution doesn’t always match the ambition. Some moments fall flat. Still, it’s memorable, thought-provoking, and absolutely worth playing for the ideas alone.

                  BioShock deserved way more hype than it got. The atmosphere is insane.
                  The world building, the visuals, the soundtrack everything pulls you in immediately. This game is not just a shooter, it’s a full EXPERIENCE.
                  The themes, the setting, the twists I LOVE all of it feels bold, creepy, and unforgettable. 
                  Genuinely one of the most unique games ever made, and it still holds up. TO THIS DAY

                  LittleBigPlanet is PURE joy. I loved this game as a kid and honestly still think it’s fun now. The creativity and the goofy little characters it feels like a game that actually wants you to mess around and create things.
                  It’s nostalgic, playful, and full of heart.
